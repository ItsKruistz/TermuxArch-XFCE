First, install wget and download the script by using `pkg install wget && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotteShock/TermuxArch-XFCE/main/archxfce4 && chmod +x ./archxfce4 && ./archxfce4`

Just wait for the script to download necessary things for you.
After that type `vncserver :1` and voil√†, you will get a XFCE environment

## If you already installed:
Run `./on` and type `vncserver :1` and you successfully booted up the XFCE environment.
